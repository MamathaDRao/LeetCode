Misc coding question
1. Count island given a matrix. The island could have invalid input, one can move across diagonals as well. 
2. Find the number of subsequences such that min(subSeq) + max(subSeq) == k; modify for min(subSeq) + max(subSeq) <= k; => pretty time versus space carefulness
3. IsSplitPossible() => given an array, is it possible to split the array in two parts such that the sum of the parts is equal => split array using indices since all indices of the array has to be used for splitting the array and getting the sum 
4. kthLargest number in an array => space not a constraint, use a tree to store k values as a heap and return the smallest maintaining heap as a minHeap
5. Implement readLine() using read4k() => is this not using a /n search for the string and ensuring that each line is being read from the 4k() lines that have been given

Design questions: ("gr-okking the system design interview")
1. Design an API for searching content information
2. Choose a data structure for search function; implement search function
3. Design a service for sending notifications when a stock price changes
4. Given a quantityDict, priceDict and orderDict, return total bill and update quantity dict. Partial fulfillment team. Implement which takes an artist and a song as an input, updates the song playcount and play the song. Also implement function getTopSong function which takes an artist as an input and returns the artist top song.
5. Given a TicTacToe board, verify if a player has won the same. 
6. Given a grid with random characters and a dictionary with words, find all words that can be created in a board. The words can occur multiple times.=> Starting a DFS for every character in the grid?? (Given a dictionary, words could be searched for DFS for each character in the dictionary)
7. Integrate rotten tomato ratings in siri's video response. (Patch?)
8. Implement a dictionary => were the things discussed hashing function, collision resolution, load factor and expansion once full; implemented dict in c# using a list (Tanenbaum)
   Getting a hash function, ensuring that each one hashes into the same bucket, discuss hash collision, implementation one of re-hash mechanisms. Choose the data structure that avoids the hashing
9. Implement a IsPalindrome function. Then implement a function, that takes string an an input, and returns a score based on how different it is from a palindrome. => Position based changes and value based changes. Number of characters that are already matching, if they are in the right positions or just characters present in wrong positions too. 
10. Design an image download library/component/service 
11. Design a compiler of a languauge like c# or java
